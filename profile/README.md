# Hi, I’m Jaxson — aka **@mixtapejaxson** 👋

I love writing code and contributing to FOSS. I tinker, I learn, and I share what I build.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I have a huge passion for **free and open-source software** and spend a lot of my free time experimenting with side projects, tools, and new ideas. When something helps me, I try to open-source it so it can help someone else too.

- 🌱 Always learning and refining my stack
- 🛠️ I enjoy building small utilities, games, and web tools
- 🤝 Happy to collaborate on FOSS issues and features

---

## 🧰 Toolbox (the stuff I reach for often)
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Bash, C/C++
- **Frameworks & Libs:** Pygame, PyQt, Node.js
- **Radio / DSP (when tinkering):** GNU Radio
- **Platforms & Tools:** Git, Linux, Firefox/Chromium DevTools, VS Codium

> _If you’re curious about something I used in a project, open an issue and I’ll document it._

## 🗺️ What I’m Into Lately
- Polishing small quality-of-life scripts
- Game mechanics experiments (clickers, autosaves, dynamic pricing)
- Frontend widgets with clean, self-contained JS + docs
- Packaging projects so they’re easy to run and extend

---

## 🚀 Projects & Highlights
- **[MixClick](https://mixclick.mixtapejaxson.com)** – clicks ↔ cash conversion, dynamic pricing, JSON saves, lucky blocks.
- **[ChatTweak](https://chattweak.com)** – A useful set of features for a *(certian)* chat application.
> _Want a write-up on any of these? File an issue on the repo and I’ll expand the README with setup, screenshots, and design notes._

## 🤝 Contributing / Collaboration
- See an issue you want to tackle? Comment and I’ll assign it.
